            formula, the magnitude of the result stays bounded or escapes to infinity. Each point in the complex plane
            corresponds to a unique fractal image, with different colors representing the number of iterations needed
            to make the magnitude of f(z) exceed a threshold.

            plays a crucial role in various scientific disciplines, including physics, chemistry, finance, and
            biology, serving as a foundational concept for understanding diffusion, molecular motion, and random
            phenomena. It has practical applications in fields like stock price modeling, particle tracking, and the
            study of diffusion in biological systems.
