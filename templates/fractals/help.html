              is a captivating mathematical set known for its intricate and self-replicating patterns. It&#39;s
              generated using the iterative formula

            <span class="text-wrapper"
              >, where z and c are complex numbers. The key idea is to determine whether, after repeatedly applying the
              formula, the magnitude of the result stays bounded or escapes to infinity. Each point in the complex plane
              corresponds to a unique fractal image, with different colors representing the number of iterations needed
              to make the magnitude of f(z) exceed a threshold.
